```
"I don't like your little errors,
Don't like your tilted loops,
The role you made me play of the fool,
No, I don't like you.

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time,
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time.
I've got a list of bugs and yours is in red, underlined.
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!"
```

## **LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO**
### You Made Me A PYTHON DEVELOPER 🐍💀✨
